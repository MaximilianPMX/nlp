# nlp

This project reimplements a basic NLP tutorial/demonstration, focusing on recreating the core embedding functionality (using InferSent) and basic sample usage for preprocessing and embedding generation.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd nlp
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Assumes you have a requirements.txt file, if not list dependencies explicitly such as: torch, numpy etc.
    ```

    *Note: You will need PyTorch installed. Please follow the PyTorch installation instructions on their website.*

4.  **Download InferSent model weights:**

    Download the InferSent model weights files from the original InferSent repository and place them in a suitable location (e.g., `resources/infersent_models`). You can adapt existing code or the `sample_usage.py` to reflect the directory path.

## Usage

### Sample Usage

You can use the `sample_usage.py` file to run the example code.

```bash
python sample_usage.py
```

This script demonstrates basic preprocessing and embedding generation using the InferSent model.

### Understanding the Code

*   `aion/dataset`: Contains dataset-related classes.
*   `aion/encoder`: Contains the InferSent encoder implementation.
*   `aion/helper`: Contains helper functions, such as text processing.
*   `aion/sample`: Contains sample code showcasing preprocessing and embedding generation.
*   `aion/util`: Contains utility functions.

See the code and comments within the `sample_usage.py` for more details on how to use this package.
