# InferSent Model

This directory contains the InferSent model implementation.

InferSent is a sentence embeddings method that obtains sentence vectors from a Bi-directional LSTM network. It is trained on natural language inference data.  This implementation provides functionalities to load the pre-trained InferSent model and generate sentence embeddings.

**Key Features:**

*   Sentence Embeddings Generation
*   Based on Bi-directional LSTM Networks
*   Trained on Natural Language Inference (NLI) Data

For more details about the model, please refer to the original InferSent paper and repository.
